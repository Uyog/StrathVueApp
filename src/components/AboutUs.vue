        Strathmore College was started in 1961 as an Advanced-level Sixth Form College offering Science and Arts subjects by a group of professionals, who formed a charitable Educational Trust (now the Strathmore Educational Trust). Strathmore College was the first in Pre-independence Kenya to accommodate all races, religions, and social standing. Saint Josemaría Escrivá, the founder of Opus Dei, inspired and encouraged them to start the College.

          In August 2002 the Commission of Higher Education awarded Strathmore a Letter of Interim Authority to operate as a University with a Faculty of Commerce and a Faculty of Information Technology.

          The first undergraduate students to enroll in these faculties completed their 4-year degree course in December 2004 and graduated in August 2005.

          In June 2007, Kenya’s Commission for Higher Education approved the award of a charter to Strathmore University.

      The University’s Charter was gazetted under the Universities Act (CAP 210B) in the ‘Kenya Gazette’ supplement no. 47 (legislative supplement no. 27) via legal notice no. 86. The charter details the establishment and functions of the University, membership, and governance of the University, administration, financial provision, and statutes of the University.
